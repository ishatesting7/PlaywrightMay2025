Why we require nodeJS (npm)
--------------------------

- Playwright is Node js Library (npm - Node Package Manager)
- Dependency Management  -  Test Runner, Browse, Binary, npm site
- Scripting and Execution - npm/npx(node package execution)
- Tools - Framework - Jest/Playwright Test + Mocha + Chai (Assertion)



Test Framework
POM 
POM + Cucumber BDD (Feature + Steps)


Folder Structure

tests-example --> Refer this for reference purpose


.gitignore --> pushing your change into repository


package.json ---> How many package you have installed so far

CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
===========================

How to write the CSS - 
--------------------
- If we are aware about the classname in the html code then the css selector would be - .classname (Note - If there is empty space in the classname then you need to replace with .)
- If we are aware about the ID in the html code then the css selector will be - #id
- If you aware about the tag, attribute and value -> tag[attribute='value']
- If you are aware about the attribute and value -> [attribute='value']




<input type="text" class="font14 fullWidth" autocomplete="off" placeholder="Enter Mobile Number" data-cy="userName" value="">


input = tag
type = attribute
text = value
